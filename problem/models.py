    **Summary**


    Ref: http://hofstrateach.org/index.php?title=Types_of_Questions

    Calculated Formula
        A [Calculated Formula] question contains a formula, the variables of which can be set to change for each user.

    Calculated Numeric
        A [Calculated Numeric] question resembles a fill-in-the-blank question. The user enters a number to complete a
        statement. The correct answer can be a specific number or within a range of numbers. Please note that the answer
        must be numeric, not alphanumeric.

    Either/Or
        In an [Either/Or]question, users are presented with a statement and asked to respond using a selection of
        pre-defined two-choice answers, such as: Yes/No, Agree/Disagree, Right/Wrong

    Essay
        [Essay] questions must be graded manually. Essay questions may use the Math and Science Notation Tool.

    File Upload
        In a [File Upload] question, users upload a file from the local drive as the answer to the question. This type
        of question is graded manually.

    Fill in the Blank
        [Fill in the Blank] answers are evaluated based on an exact text match. Accordingly, it is important to keep the
        answers simple and limited to as few words as possible.

    Fill in Multiple Blanks
        [Fill in Multiple Blanks]builds on fill-in-the-blank questions with multiple fill in the blank responses that
        can be inserted into a sentence or paragraph. Separate sets of answers are defined for each blank.

    Hot Spot
        in a [Hot Spot] question, users indicate the answer by marking a specific point on an image. A range of pixel
        coordinates is used to define the correct answer. For example in Geography to select an area QuestionTypeBaseon a map.

    Matching
        [Matching] questions allow Students to pair items in one column to items in another column. Instructors may
        include a different numbers of questions and answers.

    Ordering
        [Ordering] questions require users to provide an answer by selecting the correct order of a series of items.

    Jumbled Sentence
        In a [Jumbled Sentence], users are shown a sentence with a few parts of the sentence as variables. The user
        selects the proper answer for each variable from drop-down lists to assemble the sentence.

    Multiple Choice
        [Multiple-Choice] questions allow the users a multitude of choices with only one correct answer. In
        multiple-choice questions, users indicate the correct answer by selecting a radio button.

    Multiple Answer
        [Multiple Answer] questions allow users to choose more than one answer. The number of answer choices is limited
        to 20.

    Opinion Scale/Likert
        [Opinion Scale/Likert] questions are based on a rating scale designed to measure attitudes or reactions. This
        type of question is popular to use in surveys in order to get a comparable scale of opinion.

    Quiz Bowl
        (JeopardyÂ®-like) [Quiz Bowl] questions are a way to add fun and creativity to tests, such as self assessments or
        in-class contests. The user is shown the answer and responds by entering the correct question into a text box.

    Short Answer
        [Short Answer] questions are similar to essay questions. The length of the answer can be limited to a specified
        number of rows in the text box. Essay questions, Short Answer questions must be graded manually.

    True/False
        [True/False] questions allow the user to choose either true or false. True and False answer options are limited
        to the words True and False.

    Random Block
        [Random Block]s enable the Instructor to use a random selection of questions from a Pool. Be aware that it is
        not possible to add a Random Block of questions from another Test or Survey.

    From a Question Pool or Assessment
        Questions can be added from a [Question Pool or Assessment]. This section discusses how to select specific
        questions from Pools and other Assessments. Instructors may choose questions based on category, keyword and
        question type.

    Upload Questions
        You can use [Upload Questions] to import files containing questions into an Assessment. The questions in the
        uploaded file must match the file structure explained below. The file may include Essay, Ordering, Matching,
        Fill in the Blank, Multiple Choice, Multiple Answer, and True/False.
